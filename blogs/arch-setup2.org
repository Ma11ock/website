In the last part we created an Arch install for maximum safety, preventing any glow-in-the-darks from accessing your data. Now I'm gonna ruin it by installing proprietary software - namely Steam (bcuz I am bibeo game addict) and Discord (I hate myself).

I am a sick man... I am a wicked man.

To install Steam you have to enable multilib (just uncomment the lines in ~/etc/pacman.conf~).
