            <h1>My Setup</h1>

            
            <h2>Priorities:</h2>
            <p>
                First and foremost I prioritize free-as-in-free software over all else. I tend to have a bias for programs that I use first; whenever I try new software I'm always comparing it to its alternatives that I've used in the past. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I use to use Emacs, hence the design for this site. You'll also find some Emacs software in here
                as well.

                I no longer use Emacs as an OS replacement for two reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It isn't asynchronous. This means that whenever you start a heavy task (like update your packages) the entire editor just stops, and when you do everything in Emacs (email, rss) this is a problem. On Unix, everything runs as a separate process, so I could read my email and update my system at the same time.</li>
                <li>Elisp.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Basic Setup</h2>
            <h3>Text Editor</h3>
            
            <p>I use <a href="TODO">Joestar</a>, my fork of <a href="https://github.com/jhallen/joe-editor">Joe's Own Editor</a>.
                Joe was the first command-line text editor I  ever used, because it was the only one I could figure out how to close
            (with Ctrl-C).</p>

            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <p>I run <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye">Debian Bullseye</a> on my workstation these days. I ran <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> 
                and <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> but Manjaro became unstable after a year of use. My ThinkPad T420 is, however, still on Arch.</p>

            <h3>Desktop</h3>
            <p><a href="https://xfce.org/">i3gaps</a> is my desktop, with <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">picom</a> as
                its compositing window manager. I've experimented with several other Window Managers (bspwm and dwm come to mind)
                but I was never satisfied with my configurations. I always go back to i3.</p>

            <h3>Terminal</h3>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st">Luke Smith's build of st</a>. It is a preconfigured and patched version of the <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">suckless terminal</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>Email</h3>
            <p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Msmtp">msmtp</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync">isync</a>, and <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu/mu4e</a> so I can manage  my mail in Emacs. I use gnome-keyring to manage my passwords.
                I've tried neomutt several times in the past but I got too used to how mu4e works. neomutt also does not handle images and graphics
                as well as mu4e.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I am still stuck on GMAIL but I plan to move to my own mail server soon...
            </p>

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>I consume content mostly via my RSS feed with <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>. You can view my RSS feed <a href="files/elfeed.org">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Documents</h3>
            <p>I use Latex with the LuaLatex engine for creating my own documents.  I use Emacs's pdf-view-mode with auto-revert-mode enabled for a live environment. For pdf consumption I usually use <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">Zathura</a> or <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Gnome Document Viewer</a> if I want something bloated.</p>

            <h3>Browser</h3>
            <p><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>.</p>

                <h3>Shell</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh my zsh</a> as its package manager.</p>

                <h2>Themes</h2>
                <h3>GTK and QT</h3>
                <p>For Icons and general GTK3 I use flat-remix-blue-dark. I use Qogir dark for my window theme.</p>

                <h3>Terminal</h3>
                <p>Just simple black-on-grey-text.</p>

                <h3>Font</h3>
                <p>Terminal font is Inconsolata but Emacs uses Hack. My UI font is usually Ubuntu Regular.</p>
